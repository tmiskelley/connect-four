# Connect Four
This repository is my ruby implementation of connect four, designed for the CLI/CMD. The game can be played by running the lib/main.rb file from the terminal/command line.

# Game rules
Players take turns selecting a row to drop their marker in. Markers will always fall to the lowest available space. The first player to make either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four markers in a row wins the game.

# Project Goals
In this project, my main focus was on following the TDD framework of software development, whereas in the past I would write code and manually test it everytime I would implement a new feature, in this project I wrote spec tests before implementing any production code. This process, while at first seeming cumbersome and unecessary, did help me to stay focused strictly on the features I was working on and made it much easier to keep my code aligned with SOLID programming principles.
